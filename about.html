            <h1>About San Nicolas</h1>
            <pre>
            <h2>Etymology</h2>
            - The present name of San Nicolas was given in the year 1733, after 
            Saint Nicholas de Tolentino, who was believed to have protected the people against 
            floods, earthquakes, fires, typhoons and other calamities. It is significant that 
            in Ilocos Norte, only San Nicolas was named after a saint.

            <h2>History</h2>
            - Like any other town in the ancient province of Ilocos, San Nicolas was established 
            by Augustinian missionaries. Vigan, the first Spanish mission center in this region, 
            was founded in 1572. In the year 1575, when the Spaniards first explored the 
            Laoag (Padsan) River, they met hostile resistance from the natives of San Nicolas and Laoag. 
            In another expedition dispatched from Vigan in 1584 San Nicolas was established and Laoag 
            followed a year later.

            San Nicolas Catholic Church built in 1701 is one of the oldest buildings in this province. 
            Its original structure is one of the must see places of the town. The Church and the attached 
            Santa Rosa Academy Building, the well preserved Municipal Hall and the old Town Plaza sprawled 
            between them constitute the heart of the town center. These buildings and structures are 
            originally built and continue to be festooned with earthen bricks, which is among 
            the products of the surviving locals.
